# pizza-please

Find pizza based a chosen city.

This application utlizes [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and the [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) project. It then uses the [pizza-search](https://github.com/joefearnley/pizza-search) for accesing the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/fusion). It also uses the [Bulma CSS framework](https://bulma.io) for the UI.
